---

Handy repo/script to compare fresh `create-app` versions of Grails 3 so you can see what changed.

Just compare across tags:
* <https://github.com/erichelgeson/grails-versions/compare/3.1.7...3.1.8>
* <https://github.com/erichelgeson/grails-versions/compare/3.1.0...3.1.4>
* <https://github.com/erichelgeson/grails-versions/compare/3.0.0...3.0.9>

From the git cli:

```bash
git diff 3.1.7..3.1.8
git diff 3.1.0..3.1.4
git diff 3.0.0..3.0.9
```
